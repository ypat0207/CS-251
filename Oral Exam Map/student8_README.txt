DISCLAIMER: This live coding prompt is purposely ambiguous.  We arenâ€™t going to tell you exactly how to cout, exactly how to handle edge cases, etc.  There is no autograder and auto grading would defeat the purpose of the exercise.  Instead, you should talk through all of your thoughts and state any assumptions as you are solving the problem.  

You got this.  :D  

PROMPT:

**********************
About - The file contains a list of students favorite ice cream flavors.  The first text in the file is a string header.  Each remaining text item is a group of strings representing a student's ice cream choice(s).  As you work through the problem state any assumptions.

File reading - read the data in. Store header in a string variable and each line of data should be stored into a container of strings.  Store the container from each line into another container, leaving you with your data stored as a container of containers.  

Process/Calculations - output the total number of times "Chocolate" was said as a favorite flavor and the total amount of different ice cream flavors on the list (and print those unique flavor names).

Creative component (if time permits) - create one cin and one cout for this problem.  Make sure your code uses the cin.

Good luck!
